    "summary": "The gymnastics team will be bringing its new \"stick shell\" tomorrow to the Athens Regional at the University of Georgia, one of four regional sites leading to the National Collegiate Women’s Gymnastics Championships.",
    "body": "<p>As if dazzling flips, twists and turns weren’t enough, the Terps gymnastics team added another level of bling to behold this season: the “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TerpsGymnastics/status/1102732992815026179\">stick shell</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a new bedazzled turtle shell worn like a backpack by an athlete who nails her routine—until the next gymnast sticks <em>her</em> landing and puts it on. Other schools award a crown or even a literal stick, but sophomore Collea Burgess came up with the uniquely Terp-themed totem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The squad will be bringing it tomorrow to the Athens Regional at the University of Georgia, one of four regional sites leading to the <a href=\"https://i.turner.ncaa.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/03/24/2019_wgym_bracket_selections.pdf\">National Collegiate Women’s Gymnastics Championships</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Terps, who earned a first-round bye in the competition’s new format, will face top-seeded Oklahoma, No. 16 California and the winner of today’s play-in (either North Carolina State or New Hampshire). The top two from that session, as well as the top two from the region’s other session featuring No. 8 Georgia, No. 9 Kentucky, Missouri and Iowa State, will advance to Saturday’s regional final.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Maryland hits the mat aiming for perfects 10s, here are five things to know about the squad:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. By the Numbers</strong><br />\r\nThe Terps enter the postseason ranked No. 28 in the country, their highest pre-regional mark since 2013, when they were ranked No. 24. This is the ninth time the team has qualified for regionals under 10th-year Head Coach Brett Nelligan and the third since joining the Big Ten. “This is certainly one of the most talented teams we’ve ever had,” Nelligan said. “But what’s more important than that is their toughness. That’s what’s led us to be successful enough to get this first-round bye.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. A Balanced Team</strong><br />\r\nThe Terps will end tomorrow’s competition on the balance beam, which some teams dislike, because it can be nerve-wracking to have your fate rest on a 4-inch-wide apparatus. But Maryland gets “kind of a rush out of ending on beam,” Nelligan said. “They take it as a challenge.” In its best meet this season, Senior Sunday against Penn, Southern Connecticut and Brown, UMD scored 196.525 overall and earned a 49.200 on beam, the team’s best mark in the event in 15 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. An All-Around Star</strong><br />\r\nPerformances by sophomore Audrey Barber have been highlights for the Terps all season, including her first-place all-around finish in UMD’s session at the Big Ten Championships. She’s tied for Maryland’s all-time record on the uneven bars with a 9.925 score set last March. “She’s such a fierce competitor,” Nelligan said. “The bigger the moment, the bigger the meet, the more she wants to perform at her best.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. All in the Family</strong><br />\r\nBefore Nelligan began coaching the Terps in the 2010 season, his father, Bob “Duke” Nelligan, was at the helm for 31 years. The elder Nelligan notched 19 winning seasons and 493 victories before his son, an assistant with UMD since 2003, took over. “My goal would be to build upon the foundation that he established and take us even further to another level,” Brett Nelligan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Winners Beyond the Mat</strong><br />\r\nThe gymnastics team took home gold in their studies, with eight athletes earning Academic All-Big Ten Honors this year, the most of any winter sport at UMD. Student-athletes must be letter-winners in at least their second academic year and carry a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher to be recognized. “They have a priority list in their locker room that goes 1. School, 2. Gym, 3. Everything else,” Nelligan said.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>Although President Trump has called NATO “obsolete” and suggested the United States might not honor its mutual-defense treaty obligations, support for U.S. membership in the 70-year-old alliance remains strong across the political spectrum, according to a <a href=\"http://www.publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NATO_Report_0419.pdf\">new survey</a> by the School of Public Policy’s <a href=\"http://www.cissm.umd.edu/projects/program-public-consultation\">Program for Public Consultation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study, conducted with the nonprofit Voice of the People, presented respondents with a range of arguments for and against NATO membership. They found that 83% of the roughly 2,400 people surveyed supported the U.S. remaining in NATO, including 77% of Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The response was overwhelming,” said Steven Kull, senior research associate and director of the Program for Public Consultation. “I think it’s striking that it’s such a big majority, and that the arguments against it did really poorly.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Respondents were presented with arguments for and against U.S. membership. Supportive arguments emphasized the ongoing threat from Russia and NATO’s role in maintaining strong bonds with European countries. Anti-NATO arguments focused on the improbability of Russia attacking Europe, the expense of the alliance for the U.S. and that ties to Europe are not dependent on a military alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results held across party lines, with 76% of Trump supporters in favor of remaining in the military alliance. Support varied little from deep red districts to firmly blue ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Age also made little difference. Even among millennials, “who you might think because they grew up after the Cold War was over that it might not be as salient for them to be concerned about the threat from Russia,” 77% supported the alliance, said Kull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in the face of Trump’s attacks on the alliance that faced off against the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Kull said, the results show “how robust the support is for the NATO alliance, such that it’s not easily dislodged.”</p>\r\n",

Adams said that he carries it everywhere. Appointed to his position by President Trump in 2017—when 70,000 Americans died of drug overdoses and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency—he is focused on helping the country to navigate the opioid crisis. He called it an opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Five years ago, I wouldn't have been able to go to a town and get a mayor, the head of the hospital, the head of the health department, the schools superintendent, the sheriff and CEO of the biggest business to talk about any health issue,” he said. “But now I can go to any community in America and bring all those people together to talk about the opioid epidemic.”<img alt=\"Public health event\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b298796e-9ac6-450d-b62b-ac2226396647\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/LK3E1362_1920x1080_0.jpg\" width=\"75%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adams gave the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KIPLlVe-zQY?t=1492\">keynote address</a> at the event that drew more than 600 students, faculty, staff and community partners for a showcase of research and panels on topics including sustainability, health technology and violence prevention at the Stamp Student Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2013, Public Health Research at Maryland day has been a partnership between the University of Maryland School of Public Health and the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, made possible with funding from the University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yesterday’s event, featuring an array of panels on&nbsp;topics including sustainability in food, water and energy; health technology; and violence and human trafficking; saw broad participation from the College Park and Baltimore campuses as well as from area universities including the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, Morgan State, Towson, American and George Washington universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>School of Public Health Dean Boris Lushniak, a retired rear admiral in the U.S. Public Health Service and former deputy and acting surgeon general, welcomed these and other partners from county health departments, federal health agencies and area hospital and health care systems who also came to learn about opportunities for “working together across sectors to promote health and well-being for all.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Echoing this theme, Adams said that it is critical that public health professionals&nbsp;partner with those outside of the health sphere. He talked about how the opioid epidemic has been an opportunity for him to bring together diverse sectors of society to not just confront the crisis, but to address health broadly, including the “upstream” factors that may impact drug addiction, including mental health, traumatic childhood experiences, poverty and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to opioid addiction and other substance use (including vaping and marijuana), Adams also emphasized two other priorities: making the connection between investing in health and how it impacts economic prosperity and the links between health and safety and security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The No. 1 issue people vote on is jobs and the economy so we need to translate what we’re selling into a language that resonates with folks,” he said. “The No. 2 issue that people vote on is safety and security. If we can frame health in terms of how it makes us a safer, more secure nation or community, we’ll get more people paying attention.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Dr. Adams gave an example of Amazon moving into Northern Virginia because it is an area with a healthy workforce,” said senior public health science major Jordan Kerr, who leads the student group Public Health Action for Civic Engagement. “The idea of partnering with major corporations or other nontraditional fields to promote health was something I never considered before and led me to really think out of the box when considering different public health issues.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because health is largely driven by factors that have nothing to do with health care, such as affordable housing, jobs, access to transportation and healthy food, Adams urged “public health folks” to have the courage bring partners like business leaders, police officers, school administrators and faith leaders to the table to truly impact health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>If your best friend walks in showing off the same sweater you wore yesterday, you’d probably tell yourself imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But seeing someone flat-out copy your bread-and-butter business idea is much less charming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a program yesterday at the new Diamondback Garage, intellectual property attorney Keisha Hylton-Rodic of Hylton-Rodic Law PLLC&nbsp;guided university researchers in techniques to fend off competitors and copycats while building their companies—business skills that can be a challenge for those not grounded in startup culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the latest in an ongoing series of workshops hosted by UM Ventures, Mtech and the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship to help faculty and graduate students “transform inventions and innovations at the university into successful startups and products and services,” said Alla Corey McCoy, director of startup support for UM Ventures, and producer for the events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guest presenter Hylton-Rodic said even if innovators are building a small business in their basement, it’s crucial to put good business practices in place from the beginning to safeguard their ideas and intellectual property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When you’re starting out, it’s hard to truly see where you’re going to end up,” she said. “Most will be a dud, but you don’t know if you’ll be the next big thing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hylton-Rodic outlined four intellectual property concepts every startup innovator needs to be familiar with:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Patent: </strong>This is a legal right barring others from creating and distributing your invention for 20 years. Use this to keep a dishonest competitor from ripping off the key technology behind your laundry-folding robot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trademark/Service Mark: </strong>This is a legal right that prohibits others from using an attribute, like a word or symbol, that you use to distinguish your product or service. If you establish a recognizable brand image—an apple, for instance—a competitor can’t piggyback on your popularity with a similar mark by claiming it’s a pear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Copyright: </strong>This protects works you have authored. Songwriters and software developers should seek this as an option in safeguarding their projects, so your&nbsp;rock opera about the development of the interstate highway system doesn’t show up in a brief off-Broadway run next season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trade Secret: </strong>This refers to the proprietary method, formula or special processes you might use to make your invention a reality. It’s a protected form of intellectual property that you can defend against lowdown adversaries in court.</p>\r\n",

Puppeteer Jane Henson ’55 (Jim’s wife) started the fund that annually supports four students’ puppet projects. The topics aren’t the lighthearted stuff of Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop: Mental illness, pollution, grief and Jungian psychology are all on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just like Jim Henson made ‘The Dark Crystal’ and ‘Labyrinth,’ there is a duality,” said Brann. “It’s for children, but it’s for adults as well.”<img alt=\"Olivia Brann ’14, M.A. ’19 and puppet\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a7d50f96-8bd3-4a9d-a414-d8e41e052a6c\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/LK3E7968_1920x1080.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a high school reading of “The Bell Jar”—Plath’s semi-autobiographical novel about a young woman’s experiences with mental illness—Brann became interested in the writer and eventually created “Dear Sylvia” to “say it’s okay to not be okay, but at the end of the day you do have hope. There is light in the world.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kristen P. Ahern MFA ’19 was inspired by the Ghost Festival celebrated in Asian countries, in which ghosts and spirits are believed to emerge from their realm. When she learned that air pollution increases dramatically during the festival, she decided to create something environmentally sustainable inspired by the celebration, using recycled and found materials to build her four puppets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the things I’ve always been interested in as a designer is the waste that is created as we design,” said Ahern. “We put up plays or musicals or operas for two weeks and then everything gets thrown away or put into storage until it gets thrown away 20 years later.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using shipping boxes, bubble wrap, scrap fabric, elements of shelving units and more, Ahern created puppets inspired by fire, water, air and earth. (No puppets will be harmed during the fire component, she promises.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also presenting their projects will be Christopher Brusberg MFA ’19 and Lauren Duffy, whose work focuses on the grieving process, and MFA dance candidate Stacey Carlson ’19, whose piece explores Jungian theories of personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The showcase isn’t the only puppet-centric offering in the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies this semester; the course “Puppet Cinema: When Film and Puppetry Meet on Stage” gives students the chance to learn about the craft from puppeteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puppetry is “a part of both dance’s history and theater’s history,” said Maura Keefe, interim director of the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies. “It’s a great part of Maryland’s history as well because of Jim Henson’s legacy.”</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"typeform-widget\" data-hide-footer=\"true\" data-hide-headers=\"true\" data-transparency=\"50\" data-url=\"https://umd-digital.typeform.com/to/nRSqsI\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 500px;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<script> (function() { var qs,js,q,s,d=document, gi=d.getElementById, ce=d.createElement, gt=d.getElementsByTagName, id=\"typef_orm\", b=\"https://embed.typeform.com/\"; if(!gi.call(d,id)) { js=ce.call(d,\"script\"); js.id=id; js.src=b+\"embed.js\"; q=gt.call(d,\"script\")[0]; q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q) } })() </script>",

    "body": "<p>With a new $1 million gift from alumnus Brendan Iribe (pronounced ee-REEB'), the University of Maryland (UMD) announced today the creation of the Iribe Initiative for Inclusion and Diversity in Computing to increase diversity and foster a stronger environment of inclusion in the <a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/\">Department of Computer Science.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new funding from the co-founder of the virtual reality company Oculus will support tutoring for required introductory computer science classes, computing-related student organization activities, a computer science inclusion speaker seminar series and funding to attend computing conferences. The Initiative will also support after-school programs and summer camps for elementary through high school students from all backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Initiative will expand on the successes of the <a href=\"https://mcwic.cs.umd.edu/\">Maryland Center for Women in Computing</a> (MCWIC), which has provided a variety of opportunities for female students at UMD and local K–12 schools to engage in computing activities since 2014, to offer programs for students of all backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve been very impressed by the work Jan Plane and the center have been doing to build the pipeline for women and underrepresented groups to enter computing fields,” Iribe said. “Increasing diversity and creating a culture of inclusion in the tech industry is important to me, and I know Jan and her team will use this new funding to make an even bigger impact at Maryland.”<img alt=\"Iribe center\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7f4105ea-654c-4b6f-871a-d328d6093394\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/IribeCenter_03282019_9304_1920x1080.jpg\" width=\"70%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017–18, MCWIC supported over 1,400 K–12 students and nearly 250 UMD students through its programs. Following the launch of the Initiative, MCWIC will continue to provide specific programming for women and strengthen its current partnerships with national organizations, including the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT) and the Building Recruiting And Inclusion for Diversity (BRAID) initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are extremely grateful for Brendan’s generosity,” said the Initiative’s director, Jandelyn Plane, a principal lecturer in the Department of Computer Science who currently directs MCWIC. “It’s very motivating to have someone who shares our vision and dedication to creating an inclusive environment for everyone interested in computing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iribe said the focus belongs not on him, but on what the gift can accomplish. “It’s about creating opportunities for people who have not had access or have been traditionally excluded and then watching them grow.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Initiative will serve as an umbrella over MCWIC and will be guided by the Department of Computer Science’s Inclusion and Diversity Committee and a new student advisory board, which will be created this spring. In addition, the department; the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS); and the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences will continue to provide support. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are grateful that Brendan Iribe has chosen the University of Maryland to launch his diversity and inclusion initiative,” said Mary Ann Rankin, UMD’s senior vice president and provost. “His goal to increase diversity in computer science aligns perfectly with the university's own commitment to diversity and inclusion. His gift will not only provide additional resources to our Department of Computer Science so that they can engage with underrepresented groups in this field, but his generosity will continue to impact the academic experience for all of our students.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Computer Science, which ranks 10th&nbsp; in the nation according to Computer Science Rankings (csrankings.org), boasts one of the largest computer science programs in the country and the most popular undergraduate major on campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the efforts of Plane and MCWIC, the number of female undergraduates in the department more than doubled over the last five years. Over 650 women are currently pursuing undergraduate degrees in computer science, making it one of the largest female computer science populations in the country. The number of underrepresented minorities in the major also increased by 50 percent during the last five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iribe’s latest gift to UMD adds to his $500,000 in 2017 to MCWIC, $1 million in 2014 to establish the Brendan Iribe Scholarship in Computer Science, and a donation to the Andrew Reisse Memorial Scholarship in Computer Science, which was established in memory of Iribe’s friend and colleague who graduated from UMD in 2001 with a bachelor’s degree in computer science and mathematics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, Iribe also made a $30 million gift to fund construction of the Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering, which will be dedicated in April. Located at the corner of Baltimore Avenue and Campus Drive, the 215,000-square-foot-facility houses the Department of Computer Science and UMIACS. The building includes office and program space for the Iribe Initiative for Inclusion and Diversity in Computing and MCWIC, as well as six collaborative classrooms with interactive technologies and flexible seating for collaborative group work and experiential courses, 13 research labs and two seminar rooms.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n“Thanks to the support Brendan Iribe has provided to the University of Maryland over the past five years, we have the resources to build the pipeline and educate a more diverse group of computer scientists and conduct high-impact computing research in a new state-of-the-art building,” said CMNS Dean Amitabh Varshney.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>Demanding diners, physical exertion, late hours—all contribute to the astronomical employee turnover rate in restaurants. Ashish Gambhir ’03 wants to change that by gamifying the worker experience through his tech company, <a href=\"https://shiftone.com/\">ShiftOne</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The app, used in restaurant chains including Five Guys, Applebee’s and Burger King, works “almost the way a FitBit helps you keep track of your steps,” says Gambhir. ShiftOne connects to a business’s central data system and tracks how each employee is performing—who sells the most margaritas, responds to customers’ requests quickest and more. Employees using the app can see how they’re performing relative to co-workers and earn recognition from their managers for a job well done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping workers engaged and happy, Gambhir says, is key to slowing the turnover rate, estimated at 73 percent annually by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If ShiftOne sounds a bit like Big Brother is watching, Gambhir says employees who use the app actually have higher workplace morale. “It creates a greater sense of fulfillment and pride in what I’m doing if I’m being recognized on an ongoing basis,” he says. “A disengaged team member is four times more likely to quit, so that’s where we fit in.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than 15,000 users across the country, ShiftOne keeps employees in their jobs twice as long as regular restaurant workers, according to an internal analysis performed by the company in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They’re all enjoying the benefit: We’re extending tenure and results are improving—team members are selling more of the right product and earning better feedback,” says Gambhir, who studied information systems at Maryland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ShiftOne got started three years ago, after Gambhir and his partner sold their prior venture, a software company that monitored online restaurant reviews. When the pair would present to restaurants, they noticed how unhappy servers often were and how frequently managers “didn’t know how to use data in a way that was going to engage the crew,” Gambhir says. A manager might print out data showing who’d sold the most drinks or appetizers and post it in the back, hoping to inspire some friendly competition, “but that was more often the exception, not the norm.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gambhir and his partner have secured $2.6 million in their most recent round of funding from investors including NRD Capital, which owns Ruby Tuesday. With 16 employees, they’re hoping to revolutionize employee-restaurant relations nationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“ShiftOne has given our local operators and multi-unit managers a completely new and meaningful avenue of connection with team members,” Dan Krebsbach, president of operations at Apple American Group, Applebee’s largest franchisee, told <a href=\"https://www.foodnewsfeed.com/content/momentsnap-rebrands-shiftone\">Food News Media</a>. “It’s great for companies that care about recognition.”</p>\r\n",

We also see bad actors like bots and trolls that are not just promoting misinformation, but also seeking to sow discord or to sell you something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does social media help incite resistance to vaccines?</strong><br />\r\nPeople questioning vaccines has been around a long time, but social media has amplified voices that may not represent the larger public. When you look at the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/03/19/5-facts-about-vaccines-in-the-u-s/\">Pew survey data</a>, we still see very high support for vaccination. If you look at social media data, you might not see that. With social media and for the internet writ large, many people don’t know how to identify credible, legitimate info. That’s not a criticism of individuals… It’s more a criticism of organizations and providers that don’t necessarily help foster the kind of health literacy that’s needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about the move to push companies or websites like Amazon and YouTube to make anti-vaccine content less available?</strong><br />\r\nThat’s the $64,000 question. There’s a part of me that’s relieved in some ways it is happening. There’s another part of me that says, just because people can’t get it here doesn’t mean they won’t get it somewhere else. It’s also a little bit of a challenge for me because of the concept of freedom of speech, and I feel torn between that and reducing disinformation and fostering high vaccination rates as a collective good for our society. But I also know from our research how many of those anti-vaccine messages are paid ads—this isn’t all about private citizens expressing themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What was your reaction to the Rockland County measles emergency?</strong><br />\r\nI’m glad I’m not a Rockland County health official who had to make a decision like that. I understand the rationale from a public health perspective. One of the issues here, though, is that society has often linked fear of infectious diseases to marginalized or stigmatized communities—historically, we saw that in the fear of immigrant groups coming into the United States, or even of Americans, like in the 2014 Ebola epidemic, because of infectious disease in other countries. Unfortunately, in Rockland County this seems to have fed into fears about and discrimination against the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that lives there, and I fear the repercussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What action is needed?</strong><br />\r\nThere still are 17 states that allow for philosophical exemptions to vaccination requirements. That can just be, “I don’t believe in vaccination.” That is increasingly becoming a focus of policymakers. California after the Disneyland outbreak in 2014 and 2015 changed their state laws and did away with exceptions except for medical exemptions. In Washington State, they are literally battling that out as we speak. I think policymakers and the public are beginning to recognize we have tipped so far that we are at a danger point for these diseases. I would argue it is time to look at our policies and reconsider the implications for the health of our children and communities that result from lax laws that allow many possible exemptions for non-medical reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is anything changing for the better?</strong><br />\r\nWith the number of outbreaks and numbers of cases that just keep increasing—it’s measles now, but we’ve had pertussis outbreaks, we’ve had mumps outbreaks—I think there’s beginning to be a renewed appreciation that these diseases are dangerous, but they also are preventable. I think it is also being understood that the decision to vaccinate one’s own children is not just about one’s own children, it’s about the broader community, and particularly about protecting people who are vulnerable because they cannot be vaccinated for real health reasons. As we’ve seen in places where there are outbreaks, when you go below a certain percentage vaccinated, you lose that herd immunity that protects everyone. With the U.S. this year already surpassing the 2018 case number, I am hopeful that more legislators will take action and more parents will step forward to protect their own and others' children from unnecessary suffering.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>UMD’s Thriving Workplace Initiative is making the University of Maryland a great place to work by providing tools and support to foster engaged, inclusive and empowered faculty and staff across campus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach Monday, its Five to Thrive list offers five strategies crowdsourced from research, experts and our own UMD community to help your workplace thrive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWant to build a Thriving Workplace? Here are this week’s tips:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Don’t rely on your memory. Studies show that your active memory can only hold four things at a time, sometimes fewer. Make a habit of writing things down—whether on a phone app or in a pocket notebook. Transfer those items later to a calendar or to-do list. &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Decrease your phone dependency. Turn off your notifications, leave your phone in the kitchen at bedtime, don’t check your phone while waiting in line (try observing your environment instead); and limit your time for random surfing, say, 15 minutes.</li>\r\n\t<li>Split your lists: Instead of one big to-do list, have a “to-do” list (things you “must” do), a “watch” list (for follow-ups or reminders), and a “later” list (everything else, or things to tackle when your to-do list is empty).</li>\r\n\t<li>Be selective. When organizing a meeting, include only the people who need to be part of the conversation. This protects co-workers from overload and can keep the meeting efficient too.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get comfortable with giving up control. There might be a colleague who can do a task better. Asking for help can lead to a better outcome.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Thriving Workplace Survey begins today! Take five to 10 minutes by April 12 to reflect on life at work and help the university create more engaged, inclusive workplaces.

The cow, named Sharon, was reportedly nervous about being transported via elevator—evinced by the mess she left on the residence hall’s floors—but was unharmed. The culprits who cow-napped her from her stall at the Campus Farm were not identified. “It was a bit of a job to get it haltered and led down the elevator and back to the dairy barn,” Vic Metta, one of the rescuers, later told <em>Terp</em> magazine. <i>(Photo courtesy of University Archives)</i></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"background-color: #e6e6e6;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding: 1.5em\"><img alt=\"Streaking\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d4ce8434-6bac-42cf-80e7-927df353b361\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2019-03/image/1974Terrapin_streaking_001_2x1.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: middle\" width=\"100%\" /></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"background-color: #e6e6e6;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding: 1.5em\"><span style=\"font-size: 21px;\">1973<br />\r\n\t\t\t—</span><br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong style=\"font-size: 21px; color: #E21833\">Streaking through campus</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tThe practice of running naked in public was popular in the late 1960s and 1970s, but it was reportedly named here at the University of Maryland.

    "body": "<p>Senior goalie Megan Taylor has the best save percentage in Division I women’s lacrosse. She’s been named the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week four weeks in a row, and she’s been the conference’s Goaltender of the Year for the past three seasons. The All-American is on the watch list for the Tewaaraton Award, given to the nation’s most outstanding lacrosse player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in person, she’s less of a threat looming in the goal: She’s 5-foot-3 in cleats, happy go lucky, and might even congratulate you if you manage to score on her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I was growing up, I saw a lot of goalies, when a shot would go in, bang their stick on the pipe and be so angry,” Taylor said. “I always give credit. I’m like, ‘Oh wow, good shot!’ sometimes in a game.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has helped lead the Terps to a&nbsp;12–0 start to the season, including six&nbsp;saves to one goal allowed&nbsp;in the first half of Saturday’s 20–3 win over&nbsp;Rutgers. Her spirit, combined with her skills, flows through the defense and the team as a whole.<img alt=\"Megan Taylor\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6e58f9e8-0991-4135-9e8e-ee287c6ae528\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Taylor031619-23_1920x1080.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“She’s seeing the ball really well, she’s making some fantastic saves,” Head Coach Cathy Reese said. “She’s communicating with her defense really well and leading the way as a captain for us.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taylor can’t remember a time when she wasn’t in the cage. Her older brother, Alex, was a goalie as well, so she jumped in as a kid to test her chops. Her dad was surprised at how quickly she took to the position—and that she wasn’t scared of the ball.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Normally, I feel like a lot of goalies are bigger, they take up a lot of the goal. But I’m short,” Taylor said. “(Others) always just laugh, because they’re like, ‘There’s so much goal behind you, Meg, but we can’t get through!’”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Glenelg, Md., native has made an impact since her freshman year on the powerhouse Terps team, which has won 14 national titles. She’s started nearly every game in goal and stepped up in the big moments, like the 13–12 overtime win vs. UNC in February, during which she notched 14 saves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with all the success on the field, though, what Taylor savors are the pasta parties, the pregame meals, the hotel trips. She records a “Thumbs Up” Twitter show, named for her and fellow senior Caroline Steele’s signature hand gesture, where they play best-friend newlywed-style games and test out jellybean flavors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sometimes I think it’s funny when we talk about her,” Reese said, “because you picture this goalie that has the top save percentage in the nation that’s just so super tough and a total badass, but then there’s this sweet girl.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UMD next takes on Virginia on Wednesday, and true to Taylor’s demeanor, she’s not worrying about anything far beyond that. She’ll figure it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Wherever her path takes her, she’ll be successful,” Reese said. “She’s just such a good people person. She’s good at relationships and communicating and just has fun. She’s somebody people want to be around.”</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>As chair of the Department of Civil Environmental Engineering and an accomplished researcher, Chuck Schwartz can tame a faculty meeting or wax poetic about the porosity of asphalt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But three years ago, when he was new to his administrative post and read the responses from the first Thriving Workplace Initiative survey, he knew he needed some help strengthening the department’s culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I didn’t have all the skill sets to accomplish this,” Schwartz said, “so the Thriving Workplace Initiative (TWI) and survey came along at just the right time.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, with the help of consultants from the Center for Leadership &amp; Organizational Change (CLOC), the department has made strides in workplace culture, from instituting regular one-on-one meetings with faculty to offering new social events and lunchtime talks, and is continuing to work on topics such as workload policies and strategic planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s one success story out of the Thriving Workplace Initiative survey, which Gallup is administering to all faculty and staff today through April 12 to learn about their workplace experiences. The Office of the President, which sponsors the initiative, encourages employees to take the online survey, as it did in Spring 2016 and Fall 2017, as part of the strategic investment to foster a culture of engagement, inclusion and empowerment across campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey link is available in an email sent from Gallup to all faculty and staff. CLOC and Gallup are also offering designated dates, times and locations to share paper surveys with employees who have limited access to technology or who need assistance with translation with the brief survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Gallup, how a person feels about life at work—if they’re engaged, whether they feel supported and valued, or if their opinions matter—has a direct correlation to their well-being and the organization’s success. In 2016, UMD partnered with Gallup to gain perspective and understanding of how people across campus experience their workplaces.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Thriving Workplace survey helps campus leaders, managers and supervisors make meaningful change within their unit by examining anonymous employee responses to questions surrounding 24 critical metrics, including communication and feedback, teamwork, opportunities for development and inclusiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CEE’s 2016 survey results were a springboard for conversations between Schwartz, Assistant to the Chair Pam Lloyd and CLOC. Lloyd’s affinity for communicating and addressing the nuances of workplace culture were a complement to Schwartz’s analytical strengths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If we would have just done the survey, that in itself would have been telling, but what was really helpful was when we took the results into a session with CLOC,” Lloyd said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike staff at the University of Maryland, faculty don’t have annual performance reviews; a desire for more feedback was illuminated in the department’s results. Schwartz began instituting regular one-on-one meetings with his faculty and in the 2017 survey, the metric improved substantially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the department’s TWI ambassador, Lloyd has worked to improve staff engagement, starting small with events that bring together the people of CEE. In addition, both she and Schwartz have encouraged staff and faculty to take full advantage of TWI programming, like Fearless Conversations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This past year, thousands of faculty and staff took advantage of these TWI resources. Luke Chenevert, a Facilities Management manager, accessed nearly all of them in an effort to create a culture of transparency and candor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I saw the benefit of this initiative immediately,” he said. “For our group, breaking down barriers brings a lot of perspective, but also helps you learn what you need to know really quickly.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laura Tan, associate director in the Department of Resident Life, saw her scores increase from the first survey to the second by committing to fostering an environment where staff members feel comfortable sharing and fully engaging. “My hope for the 2019 survey is to collect additional feedback that will help our department continue to grow, improve and thrive.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "summary": "Elite gymnast Aly Raisman came to campus for the Hear the Turtle event presented by Student Entertainment Events; the series welcomes speakers who can discuss issues that impact students.",
    "body": "<p>Before she won six Olympic medals and led Team USA at the past two Summer Games, Aly Raisman was a young gymnast who was told she didn’t need a leotard for competition, since she hadn’t mastered the floor routine. That turned out to be the event for which she earned gold in 2012 and silver in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I sort of always surpassed (my coaches’) expectations, because I think it’s always important to be a hard worker than be born with this crazy talent,” she told a crowd of Terps last night in the Stamp Student Union. She came to campus for the Hear the Turtle event presented by Student Entertainment Events; the series welcomes speakers who can discuss issues that impact students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raisman has worked to overcome obstacles on and off the mat. One of hundreds of gymnasts sexually abused by convicted former Team USA doctor Larry Nassar, she’s using her platform to advocate for survivors and has actively promoted systemic changes in gymnastics and efforts to prevent such abuse in youth sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As hard as it is to be honest about what you’re going through, I think you’d be surprised by how many people around you can relate to you,” Raisman said. “You’re really not alone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other topics she discussed at last night’s event:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>On being an elite athlete:</em></strong> Raisman, who’s been involved in gymnastics since attending Mommy and Me classes as a 2-year-old, said the most difficult part of competing on the Olympic stage is the pressure to win. Only five athletes made the team (it’ll be cut to four in 2020), and the role is mentally and physically draining. But keeping perspective is key, she said. “People will always remember you for the kind of person you are rather than what place you are on the podium.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>On coming forward about sexual abuse:</em></strong> While sharing her story was difficult because she didn’t know how people would react—including those with USA Gymnastics—Raisman did it anyway because the issue is “so much bigger than myself.” So many women—and men, she noted—are survivors of sexual abuse, and she doesn’t think it should be swept under the rug. “Everyone’s story matters,” she said. “I knew if I came forward, I’d hopefully add some pressure.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>On wellness and mental health:</em></strong> Taking time for yourself each day is crucial, Raisman said. She has turned to therapy, journaling and a meditation app to help her process her thoughts and emotions, and she emphasized the importance of a good support system. “If you don’t have five minutes in your day, then you need to take an hour,” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>On positive body image and looking as you please without judgment:</em></strong> Wearing what you want, when you want should never be viewed as an invitation for sexual advances, Raisman said. And women shouldn’t shame women for the way they look or dress. “People will say, ‘Oh, well you’re wearing a leotard, so it’s your fault,’” she said. “It’s never your fault.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>On what’s next:</em></strong> Raisman has partnered with the nonprofit Darkness to Light and the Flip the Switch campaign to encourage adults involved in youth sports to complete a sexual abuse prevention training program. Now she’s working on a project with Lifetime to share stories of victims; she’ll be an executive producer of the TV show and is looking forward to continuing to educate the public on the issue. “It’s really important for me to use my platform to give people a voice,” she said.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>The first myth of the UMD&nbsp;Puzzlehunt is that it’s quiet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine a room, or three, of students lined up at tables, hunched over thick packets of mind-bending word, pictorial and number games. They read the directions, their brains start running, then POW! Someone jumps up to ask if anyone has a deck of cards, or to suggest checking a stanza in Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Raven” or to just offer—or reject—a possible strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third annual event, to be hosted on Sunday by the University of Maryland Puzzle Club, will bring together scores of Terps to solve cyphers, conquer Morse code&nbsp;and tackle quip-filled logic tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s cerebral. It’s creative. It’s collaborative,” said Ryan Thomas ’20, a computer science major and club treasurer who wears the enviable title of a “puzzlemaster.” “Sometimes it feels nerdy, like something only five people would enjoy, but then so many come out.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition starts with club members deciding on a whimsical theme—in previous years, it centered on libraries and a criminal investigation, and this year it’s space adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competitors, in teams of up to five, are handed a pile of 22 to 25 student-crafted puzzles broken into four modules. Most can be solved as one-offs, but “meta” puzzles, which combine elements from the solutions of other puzzles in the modules, are worth more points. And the “meta-meta” puzzle, the overarching one for all four modules, is the real jackpot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The winner is the team that solves the meta-meta first. But the second myth may be that the Puzzlehunt is&nbsp;about prizes, rather than pride. This year, the award is a packet of Neapolitan-flavored freeze-dried astronaut ice cream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Want to try your hand (or brain) at a few puzzles?

    "body": "<p>Spring is springing earlier because of human-induced climate change, and <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212010\">new research</a> from the School of Public Health suggests we’re increasingly paying the price for it—sneeze by itchy, scratchy sneeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study, based on over 300,000 respondents between 2002 and 2013, shows that seasonal allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, increases when the timing of spring “greenup” changes. The findings were published yesterday in the journal PLOS ONE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We found that areas where the onset of spring was earlier than normal had 14 percent higher prevalence of hay fever,” said Associate Professor Amir Sapkota in the Maryland Institute for Applied Environmental Health. “Surprisingly, we also found similar risk in areas where the onset of spring was much later than what is typical for that geographic location.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study provides the first national-level quantitative data showing how ongoing climate change is increasing the seasonal allergic disease burden in the United States. Hay fever affects 25 million adults in the United States and results in $11.2 billion in related medical expenses annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sapkota and his team used satellite data collected by NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to identify the start of the spring season throughout the U.S. and linked these data to National Health Interview Survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Previous studies have shown that plant phenology is highly dependent on temperature. As such, it is one of the most sensitive indicators of how our ecosystem is responding to climate change,” said Chengsheng Jiang, a research assistant professor of applied environmental health and study co-author. “We show that such climate change-driven ecological changes are directly linked to allergic disease burden in the United States. Even a relatively small change in the timing of tree flowering can have a significant economic impact, given that 25 million American adults already suffer from hay fever each year.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raghu Murtugudde, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, was another co-author on the paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for increased hay fever when spring arrives early seems to be related to pollen exposure. An earlier onset of spring means trees flower sooner and create a longer season for tree pollen, which is the major source of spring seasonal allergens. But a very late onset of spring may mean many species of trees simultaneously burst in bloom, blasting allergy sufferers with a high concentration of pollen for a shorter duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s yet another example of how climate change is impacting burden of allergic disease right here in our backyard, Sapkota said. Given that climate change is projected to intensify, he argued such data are critical to inform public health adaptation strategies, including early warning systems. “Climate change impacts our health in more ways than we can imagine. We need community-specific adaptation strategies to increase resilience and minimize the disease burden associated with climate change,” he said.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>An online platform to support LGBTQ youth and a chatbot app addressing vaccine misinformation both won yesterday’s second annual Gold Public Health Innovation Award competition hosted by the School of Public Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teams behind Q Chat Space and ChatHealth&nbsp;each took home half of the $5,000 in prize money at the event, established with a gift from SPH founding Dean Robert Gold and his wife, Barbara, to spark public health innovation, design thinking and solutions to the world’s most complex public health issues.<img alt=\"Gold winners\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"06dba49b-c3aa-4253-a717-561695c0a44d\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/DSC_3897_1.JPG\" width=\"50%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It was so much fun to see the high quality of all the projects that were presented today,” SPH Dean Boris D. Lushniak said. “I didn’t envy the judges because all these projects were great and focused on helping people in new and innovative ways.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The judging panel featured Andre Blackman ’05, founder and CEO of health innovation workforce development startup Onboard Health; Dr. Alyssa Todaro Brooks Ph.D. ’15, scientific program specialist at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center; Thomas Garson, an adviser to the SPH’s Center on Aging; and Ed Woods, president of TerpSys, an information and technology services company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of their winning choices, Q Chat Space, was developed by family science doctoral student Natasha Williams to provide LGBTQ youth with access to an affirming online community moderated by trained facilitators. The facilitators, like Williams, have a background in counseling therapy and will provide mental health support and resources to rural youth, youth of color and others who may be socially isolated from their peers and are at higher risk for being victims of violence and bullying, depression and suicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams, who is advised by Assistant Professor Jessica Fish, partnered with CenterLink, a community of LGBTQ centers, Planned Parenthood and PFLAG on the project. She has already piloted QChat Space and plans to roll it out nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“To have the chance to continue to impact the lives and well-being of queer youth around the country who face so many challenges, it is super meaningful,” Williams said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biological sciences and public health science major Veeraj Shah and computer science major Neil Johnson developed the other winning entry, ChatHealth, which can answer student questions about vaccines using AI and machine learning. Their goal is to address vaccine misinformation and increase the numbers of college students taking vaccines for preventable diseases like HPV, which is responsible for 99% of cervical cancers, and influenza, for which fewer than half of college students regularly get vaccinated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson and Shah, sophomores who both received the HPV vaccine as children, expressed surprise at how many of their peers haven’t gotten vaccinated and still don’t due to a lack of understanding about the effectiveness of vaccines. Working with the University Health Center, the Student Health Advisory Committee and the UMD Help Center, they hope to roll out ChatHealth on campus by Spring 2020 and envision deploying it at other universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other competing teams included Padres Preparados, Jóvenes Saludables (Prepared Parents, Healthy Youth), a parent and youth mobile nutrition app pitched by doctoral students<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmaraChannell\"> </a>Amara Channell Doig (behavioral and community health) and Matt Rodriguez (family science) that enables Latino fathers to more easily participate in a family-skills program to improve their children’s diet and physical activity, and DiSyringe, a handheld diagnostic tool pitched by math major Zakariya Kmir that seeks to revolutionize infectious disease detection. Both projects are already in use or have funding support from other sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our first year was focused very inwardly in the SPH, but we’ve now grown beyond the borders of our school in the second year,” said Assistant Professor Neil Sehgal, faculty mentor for the Gold Award. “I am thrilled to see how the Gold Award is contributing to the innovations environment across campus and that students are seeing us as the home for health innovation at UMD.”</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>The University of Maryland Libraries will digitize videos that document the works of a celebrated Maryland dance company founded by an alumna, thanks to a $313,753 National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant announced yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 1976, the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange in Takoma Park, Md., gained international acclaim by producing more than 100 innovative dance or theater works and touring throughout the United States and abroad. The project will make freely available online 1,329 videotape recordings of rehearsals and performances as well as 211 performance programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“NEH has been extremely generous to the University Libraries over the years by awarding grants critical to the growth of our digitization program,” said&nbsp;Interim Dean of Libraries Babak Hamidzadeh. “We’re grateful for their support and for their confidence in our expertise.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lerman ’70 is a visionary choreographer, performer and educator and one of the first to incorporate advocacy in creating her works. She empowered seniors and movement-impaired dancers, in part, by choreographing for her company’s adjunct troupe of senior dancers, Dancers of the Third Age. Throughout her career, she has influenced&nbsp;the worlds of performance, arts-based community engagement and cross-disciplinary collaboration, winning critical and scholarly attention.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nIn 2004, the Dance Exchange gave its archive to the Michelle Smith Performing Arts Library, part of the University Libraries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Liz Lerman Dance Exchange records are an ideal example of a collection of a locally grown dance company that ascended to international recognition,” said&nbsp;Vincent Novara, curator for special collections in performing arts at the Michelle Smith Library. “We’re pleased to have this opportunity to widen the reach and access for scholars and fans of dance to these unique video documents of such innovative and thought-provoking works.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The videos document rehearsals, works in development and performances, as well as Critical Response Process exchanges, which showcase the pioneering four-step process that Lerman devised for giving and receiving feedback on any form of artistic work in progress.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nDigitizing the recordings also preserves them: A previous pilot project to digitize 100 of the Lerman videotapes revealed that they were degrading. An estimated 15 percent of the tapes had audiotrack loss or severe audio distortion, which means that a considerable part of the performance had been&nbsp;lost.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>Legal threats and guilt campaigns haven’t deterred buyers of knockoff high-end handbags. But what about social shaming?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In new research, Maryland Smith’s Yajin Wang, assistant professor of marketing, reveals a more effective way to combat the growing counterfeit market: Let consumers know that no matter how convincing the imposter, others can tell it’s a fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, she said, the primary motivation for buying a luxury designer accessory is to impress others. If the knockoff has the opposite effect, the allure is lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Consumer desire for counterfeit luxury goods is largely driven by social motives, such as signaling status, gaining social approval and communicating your identity to others,” said Wang. Her research, believed to be the first to examine counterfeit luxury use in a social context, was published in the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcpy.1071\"><em>Journal of Consumer Psychology</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many handbag replicas cost just a few dollars and are made of plastic, from the imitation leather to the cheap gold-colored clasps, others can cost hundreds of dollars, and are crafted from finely stitched leather, with real silk interiors and gold-plated emblems. It’s estimated that together, the good and bad counterfeits account for more than 7 percent of the sales of global luxury goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guilt campaigns by Cartier, Chanel and other designers have essentially admonished consumers about the moral or legal implications of buying phony goods. But that approach has found limited success. In surveys, half of respondents admitted to buying counterfeit goods, despite believing that doing so is morally and legally wrong. They often justify the purchases with some moral disengagement, Wang said, for example, by complaining that they couldn’t afford the real thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wang, with co-authors Jennifer Stoner from the University of North Dakota and Deborah Roedder John from the University of Minnesota, conducted five studies examining the impact of social interactions on moral disengagement and behavior among women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They loaned luxury goods—Burberry scarves, Tiffany bracelets and Louis Vuitton handbags—to female research subjects and told them to imagine they had purchased the items at a steep discount at an outdoor market while studying abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were then given a computer survey to complete about luxury items, during which they would be interrupted briefly by an actor, who would comment on the item. Some would deliver a “high-authenticity signal” that indicates that they believe the item to be real—“It looks cute on you.”—or a “low-authenticity signal” that indicates that they suspect it’s a fake,—“Is it real?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subjects were given $8 for participating in the study and were offered a chance to buy a $1 raffle ticket to win a counterfeit bag. Those who believed they had been caught carrying a fake spent far less money on the raffle—about half of what the other group spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detecting the heightened social anxiety response to the earlier studies, the researchers then tested the effectiveness of an ad campaign that focused not on the guilt of buying a fake or the threat of legal ramifications, but the shame of being caught using a phony.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign’s slogans zeroed in on that social anxiety, saying it’s easy for other people to spot counterfeits. It said: “When it’s fake, we ALL know it’s fake. Fake purses are easy for others to spot. Don’t take the chance. Buy real.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Consistent with our prediction, women viewing the social anxiety advertisement were less interested in purchasing counterfeit luxury products than women viewing the control advertisement,” the study found.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>Self-driving cars could make driving safer, with fatigue and distraction—not to mention irritation at that idiot who just cut you off—all taken out of the equation. (Plus, you might get to read or catch a few extra z’s.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Autonomous vehicles will hit the market only when they can respond to driving challenges without fail, whether from ice, downpours and other environmental challenges, or from erratic drivers and headphone-wearing pedestrians with a death wish. A full determination of the capabilities of the vehicles’ systems could require hundreds of millions of miles of test drives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But don’t cancel your plans for a nap while commuting just yet: University of Maryland computer scientist Dinesh Manocha, in collaboration with a team of colleagues from Baidu Research and the University of Hong Kong, has developed a photo-realistic simulation system for training and validating self-driving vehicles that can make the whole process faster and easier to evaluate in the lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a paper <a href=\"http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/28/eaaw0863\">published yesterday</a> in the journal <i>Science Robotics</i>, the researchers described their new system, called Augmented Autonomous Driving Simulation (AADS), which aims to provide a richer, more authentic simulation than current systems that use game engines or high-fidelity computer graphics and mathematically rendered traffic patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This work represents a new simulation paradigm in which we can test the reliability and safety of automatic driving technology before we deploy it on real cars and test it on the highways or city roads,” said Manocha, one of the paper’s corresponding authors, and a professor with joint appointments in computer science, electrical and computer engineering, and the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current state-of-the-art simulation systems fall short in portraying photo-realistic environments and presenting real-world traffic flow patterns or driver behaviors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AADS is a data-driven system that more accurately represents the inputs a self-driving car would receive on the road. Self-driving cars rely on a perception module, which receives and interprets information about the real world from cameras and other sensors, and a navigation module that makes decisions, such as where to steer or whether to brake or accelerate, based on the perception module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In current simulator technology, the perception module receives input from computer-generated imagery and mathematically modeled movement patterns for pedestrians, bicycles and other cars. As a simulation of the real world, it is both crude and time-consuming to generate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, the AADS system combines photos, videos and lidar point clouds—which are like 3D renderings—with real-world trajectory data for road users. Because it’s based on actual driving, it’s far more realistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(W)e’re capturing real behavior and patterns of movement,” Manocha said. “The way humans drive is not easy to capture by mathematical models and laws of physics.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the researchers extracted data about real trajectories from a wide range of driving videos, and modeled driving behaviors using social science methodologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This data-driven approach has given us a much more realistic and beneficial traffic simulator.” Manocha said. “Because of the realism of the simulator, we can better evaluate navigation strategies of an autonomous driving system.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Watch a video demonstration of the AADS system below</em>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfxqXhcMH5g\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n",

Barney Frank, a lead author of the federal response to the Great Recession, told a University of Maryland audience yesterday that he doesn’t foresee a similar catastrophe in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frank, known for the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, explained that financial institutions are still carrying less risk and keeping larger reserves than before the Wall Street meltdown in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I see very little chance of a financial crisis,” he said. “(But) at some point, the innovation outruns the regulation.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Massachusetts congressman from 1981 to 2013 who chaired the House Financial Services Committee from 2007–11, Frank took part in a Q&amp;A at the David C. Driskell Center with Thomas Edsall, an opinion columnist for The New York Times. The occasion was the 2019 Fishlinger Family Lecture, hosted by the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, the Center for the Study of Business Ethics, Regulation and Crime (C-BERC) and the Robert H. Smith School of Business.<img alt=\"Barney Frank and crowd\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8850722e-8de8-4f6e-9f21-6642ec70b20a\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/BarneyFrank_03272019_5939_1920x1080.jpg\" width=\"60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frank said the bulk of the financial reform bill has “held up pretty well,” outside of how he believes the Trump administration has curtailed the effectiveness of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“With the exception of CFPB,” he said, “they have not done serious damage.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other issues in the conversation included:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sexuality: In 1987, Frank was the first member of Congress to voluntarily come out as gay, and in 2012 was the first to marry a same-sex partner. While at the start of his career, being gay appeared to be an impediment to being a politician, Frank said that by the time he retired, “it was much more socially acceptable to be gay.” He said he is struck by how “it’s no big deal” that Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., is gay and married.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Lobbying: While big banks have clout with regulatory agencies, lobbying on actual legislation is more influential when it comes from the smaller institutions that are found in every politician’s district, Frank said. “Everybody’s got community bankers. They are everybody’s pal.”<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Earmarks: Frank said the ongoing ban on earmarks, which are often used to trade funding a local project for a vote, is a mistake. While lists of pork projects can rile up voters on the lookout for wasteful spending, “they are ways to get unpopular things done.”<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Progressive politics: While new members of the House of Representatives have been touting reform proposals such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, Frank believes they are overstating how much popular support those measures actually have. “They see a majority sentiment for their views in the country which I wish was there,” he said. “They are unwise in their strategy.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>A virtual natural disaster slammed campus over spring break as the Division of Information Technology simulated the loss of the University of Maryland’s primary data center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drill on March 17 and 18 had nearly three dozen staffers scrambling to ensure that the campus’s IT infrastructure could keep running in the event of a fire, hurricane, flood or whatever else Mother Nature could throw at us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The team has three to four hours from the time we start this to demonstrate that all the critical applications are working in our backup data centers,” said Jeffrey K. Hollingsworth, UMD vice president and chief information officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The applications they restarted from backups include ones vital to the university’s financial and payroll activities, student records and human resources databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exercise generally went according to plan, with a few “interesting” diversions from the expected, Hollingsworth said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t score this on how many things go perfectly the first try,” he said. “I look at when something doesn’t go perfectly on the first try, how well and effectively can you get around it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hollingsworth offered a three-tiered plan for making sure you don’t lose data in case of a fire, flood, burglary or other series of unfortunate events—even if you’re cut off from Wi-Fi or the cloud:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have a physical backup, and keep it in a different building. “This goes for everyone with a laptop the same as it does for a manager of an IT system.”<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Maintain a healthy skepticism. “If the software says it’s backing up, trust but verify. Try to restore a few files to make sure it’s working.”<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Whether in an large organization or two-person household, “Make sure more than one person knows how to do the backup and restore. You need redundancy in your people, not just your technology.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>In the plush bar of his Foggy Bottom restaurant, Marcel’s chef and owner Robert Wiedmaier tastes a cherry mousse dotted with cookie crumbs brought to him by his pastry chef, who awaits his verdict. As suited men buzz by him setting up for dinner, Wiedmaier, dressed in his chef’s whites, considers the pale pink confection for a moment and then proclaims, “It’s delicious.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This late March afternoon marks the 20th anniversary of the opening of Marcel’s, the tony French-Belgian restaurant that the former UMD student named after his first son. This year, Marcel’s is a semifinalist for a prestigious James Beard Award in the category of Outstanding Service. Finalists for the 2019 awards, the Oscars of the restaurant industry, will be announced today, with the winners named in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“People are very finicky about restaurants,” said Wiedmaier of his ability to keep a restaurant relevant for two decades in the ever-changing Washington, D.C., scene. “They can eat at a restaurant 20 times and have a great time, but then they go one time and don’t like it and they won’t go back. They’ll go someplace else. So it’s really putting your heart and soul into something and pushing it every day.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Germany to a Belgian father and a Californian mother, Wiedmaier “ended up hanging out in the kitchen all the time” with his mother and grandmother, who he describes as “unbelievable cooks.” Going to local markets and tasting produce from farms near the small German village where the family lived helped spark Wiedmaier’s interest in food and cooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wiedmaier knew he wanted to be a chef, but his father pushed for a college degree. After finishing culinary school in the Netherlands, Wiedmaier came to UMD in the early 1980s, a result of his father’s links to Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though he declared a major in psychology (and made longtime friends as a member of the Theta Chi fraternity), Wiedmaier decided after two years to return to Europe and make a go of it in restaurants. He cooked in kitchens in Brussels and London before returning to D.C. to work at the Four Seasons and the Watergate. Since opening Marcel’s in 1999, he’s expanded to a mini-empire of 10 more restaurants in the region, including Brasserie Beck and Siren, which earned a Michelin star.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’re not just selling food, we’re selling an experience,” said Wiedmaier. “You know you’re going to come and eat something that you might not normally eat.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcel’s menu—which has been sampled by celebrities like George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey and “every senator or congressman in the city,” according to Wiedmaier—is filled with special-occasion creations. “You can choose among plates such as buttery lobster navarin with lobster-filled ravioli, the most ethereal of boudin blancs, and a supremely flavorful pepper-crusted entrecote,” wrote <em>Washingtonian </em>in February, when it ranked Marcel’s No. 36 on its list of the 100 best restaurants in D.C. The magazine also noted that “this is the sort of place where you can rest in the knowledge that servers and sommeliers will know what you want—sometimes even before you do.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I want to see Marcel’s be here another 30, 40 years,” said Wiedmaier. “You go to Paris, there are restaurants that have been there 30, 40, 100 years. There’s no reason why Marcel’s can’t.”</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>Middle schoolers who feel their parents are more involved in their education have fewer mental health problems resulting from being victims of bullying, including fewer suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and less overall difficulty with mental health, new research from the College of Education finds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lack of perceived parental involvement appears to have the opposite effect on students, resulting in more mental health issues and more suicidal thoughts and behaviors, according to the paper published this month in the journal <em>School Psychology</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research findings have particular resonance in an era of increasing adolescent suicide rates; according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, suicide rates have risen more than 30% in half of states since 1999. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for young people, claiming the lives of more than 6,000 people ages 10 to 24 in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The middle school years can be challenging for students: Bullying becomes more&nbsp; prevalent, several mental health disorders have their onset during this period, and parents tend to become less involved in children’s education. The research, based on data collected from more than 300,000 Georgia students at 615 middle schools, suggests that parents who maintain involvement can play an important role in their adolescents’ mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Peer victimization has been linked to increased risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among youth, and we wanted to identify some protective factors,” said the lead author Cixin Wang, an assistant professor in the Department of Counseling, Higher Education, and Special Education. “At the school level as well as individual level, perceived parental involvement in education was related to fewer suicidal thoughts and behaviors, suggesting it is a protective factor.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous studies have examined how parental involvement in education, ranging from help with homework to simply talking about school, helps children’s academic achievement. But less is known about whether parental involvement in education also benefits school children’s socio-emotional health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the findings, parental involvement acted as a protective factor against only face-to-face bullying, not cyberbullying. Additionally, parental involvement was more protective for girls than boys and more so for eighth-grade students than sixth and seventh graders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers also compared the results for students from Asian, black, Latino and white backgrounds, expecting the buffering effect of parental involvement might be stronger for minority students. “But in general, we found that parental involvement was more beneficial for white students compared with ethnic minority students,” Wang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the research points to the critical need for parents to stay in tune with schoolchildren’s mental health, an issue not given enough attention in the past, she said. In addition, the need to prevent cyberbullying and reduce its negative impact on youth is key, but it is not yet fully understood, and may require additional research, Wang said.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>The University of Maryland has named a longtime higher education administrator in the fields of diversity and equity to its new position of vice president of diversity and inclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgina Dodge, who will join the University of Maryland in June, will work closely with senior leaders, faculty, staff, students and external constituencies to advance diversity, equity, inclusion and respect as core institutional values. She will be a member of the President’s Cabinet​ and work with the senior vice president and provost, the Provost’s Council of Deans and other senior leaders to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Following a highly competitive national search, Georgina was selected based upon her 23-year career of successful leadership in diversity, equity and inclusion at three universities,” said university President Wallace D. Loh. “She is a tireless advocate for human rights, civil liberties and equal opportunity, and we welcome her to Maryland.”<img alt=\"Dodge\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"064738a2-67a0-4625-bd3b-6c6f9b02ea2f\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Georgina_Dodge-010_300x375.jpg\" width=\"35%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2017, Dodge has served as chief diversity officer and associate provost for diversity, equity and inclusion at Bucknell University. She held similar roles as chief diversity officer, associate vice president and Title IX coordinator at the University of Iowa, and assistant vice provost of the Office of Minority Affairs at the Ohio State University, where she convened and directed the university’s Bias Assessment and Response Team, produced the university’s annual diversity report and helped develop metrics for diversity performance evaluations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I am honored to be chosen to lead diversity and inclusion at the University of Maryland,” said Dodge. “Across many higher education institutions, I have listened and learned from the communities I serve, and I look forward to partnering across the university to foster a vibrant and inclusive climate for all.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A first-generation college student, Dodge brings a unique perspective to Maryland as an individual who took an unconventional path to educational and professional success. Prior to her career in academics, she served in the U.S. Navy as an electronics technician. Upon completion of her six-year enlistment, Dodge began her pursuit of an A.A. from Golden West Community College in Huntington Beach, Calif. After graduating with honors, Dodge completed a B.A. in English from the University of California Irvine, graduating<em> summa cum laude</em>. She went on to earn both her M.A. and Ph.D. in English from the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a six-year appointment as an assistant professor of English at the Ohio State University, where she taught courses in African-American, Asian, multiracial and women’s literatures, Dodge became director of the Department of African American and African Studies at the community extension center in Columbus, Ohio. There, she developed and implemented enrichment courses for community residents, worked with city and community officials on citizen beneficial partnerships, and continued to develop multiethnic-focused courses under the university umbrella.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with her various memberships to professional organizations like the Association of Title IX Administrators and Association on Higher Education and Disability, she organized the Women of Color Caucus within the Society for the Study of Multi-Ethnic Literatures of the United States&nbsp;and has served in several other positions throughout her career. Dodge was also <a href=\"https://diverseeducation.com/article/125812/\">featured</a> on the September 2018 cover of&nbsp;<em>Diverse: Issues in Higher Education</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Junior&nbsp;Stephanie Jones&nbsp;added 15 points, including the Terps’ first seven of the game, and freshman&nbsp;Shakira Austin&nbsp;notched 15 points with 10 boards and six blocks. Freshman&nbsp;Taylor Mikesell&nbsp;added 14 points.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I can’t say enough about the game, the amazing crowd, the environment that we had,” head coach&nbsp;Brenda Frese&nbsp;said. “You know, you talk about an entertaining game for our sport, and you just witnessed two really good, deserving Sweet 16 teams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I thought UCLA was tremendous in the first half. I thought it took us a while, especially on the glass and to be able to get kind of settled in. Obviously, Steph was key for us to be able to kind of hold it together there in the first half. But loved our response coming out of the locker room in the second half. I thought that it was sensational. Kaila did everything she could possibly do for us. You know, scratch, claw and made play after play for us.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bruins pulled down 17 offensive rebounds in the first 20 minutes and scored 17 points off of them to take a 44–40 lead into the break.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComing out of halftime, Maryland went on a 7–0 run to take the lead at 49–46.

A three-point play by Lindsay Corsaro put UCLA up three at 79–76 with 3:35 to go.

UCLA went 20 for 21 from the free throw line.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis marked Maryland’s 27th appearance in the NCAA Tournament, ninth straight and 15th overall bid in Frese’s 17 years at Maryland. The Terrapins are 46–26 (.639) all time in the NCAA Tournament and 34–14 (.708) under Frese. She’s led the Terps to eight Sweet Sixteens, six Elite Eights, three Final Fours and the 2006 NCAA title.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Terps won the Big Ten regular season title and advanced to their fifth straight Big Ten championship game earlier this month. Charles was named to the All-Big Ten Tournament Team after averaging 26.3 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.0 steals in the Terps’ three-game run to the Big Ten Tournament final. She notched a career-high 36 points, off 15-for-30 shooting from the field, with 9 boards in the championship game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharles is one of five of the nation’s top small forwards as a finalist for the Cheryl Miller Award.

    "body": "<p>For those who live with psoriasis—an incurable autoimmune skin condition that affects nearly 8 million Americans and 125 million people worldwide—the potential impacts don’t end with just the physical symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to new research from the UMD Department of Sociology, the judgmental and stereotypical responses that can greet sufferers with the condition’s scaly, itchy skin patches are stressful, too, and can make them feel “disgusting,” “filthy” and “broken.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Skin is an important part of one’s appearance and plays a critical role in establishing interpersonal relationships,” said Dr. Alex Parkhouse, a medical sociologist whose <a href=\"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/png/ajhb/2019/00000043/00000002/art00002\">study</a> was recently published in the <em>American Journal of Health Behavior</em>. “Television commercials and other advertisements contribute to the visibility of psoriasis, but often inadequately characterize life with the condition and neglect to highlight hidden burdens, like stigma, affecting daily life.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the study, Parkhouse conducted in-depth interviews with 23 people living with psoriasis in the United States. Many participants said they felt others viewed them as “different,” a perception that resulted in everything from skipping school and family-related functions to sexual and intimacy issues and shaping career goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You know, when your elbows and ears and face and legs are all red and scaly and gross, people don’t see you as being attractive,” Alan, a 36-year-old service worker from New York, said in the study. “They don’t see you as being normal. It influences your popularity, how people interact with you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants also revealed how personal and social resources such as friends, family, health care professionals and support groups can help them cope with and manage the effects of stigma-stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s just nice to tell people about it, just someone to talk to, really,” Laura, a 19-year-old college sophomore from New Hampshire, said in the study. “It’s nice to have that because they (friends and family) don’t get grossed out or anything. They’ll listen to me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parkhouse hopes his research contributes to a better understanding of psoriasis and other chronic illness-related stigma-stress.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>Physicists at the University of Maryland have developed a new method to detect radioactive material—one that could be scaled up and used to scan trucks and shipping containers at ports of entry, providing a powerful tool to fight smuggling of these dangerous materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By using an infrared laser beam to induce a phenomenon known as an electron avalanche breakdown near the material, the new technique is able to detect shielded material from a distance. To counter the threat of nuclear terrorism, federal law requires all cargo containers arriving at U.S. ports to be screened for radioactive threats; this method improves upon current technologies that require close proximity to the radioactive material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers described their proof-of-concept experiments in a <a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/3/eaav6804\">research paper</a> published Friday in the journal <em>Science Advances.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Traditional detection methods rely on a radioactive decay particle interacting directly with a detector. All of these methods decline in sensitivity with distance,” said Robert Schwartz, a physics doctoral student at UMD and the lead author of the research paper. “The benefit of our method is that it is inherently a remote process. With further development, it could detect radioactive material inside a box from the length of a football field.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As radioactive material decays, it emits particles that strip electrons from—or ionize—nearby atoms in the air, creating a small number of free electrons that quickly attach to oxygen molecules. By focusing an infrared laser beam into this area, Schwartz and his colleagues easily detached these electrons from their oxygen molecules, sparking an avalanche-like rapid increase in free electrons that is relatively easy to detect. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This is not a new phenomenon, but we are the first to use an infrared laser to seed an avalanche breakdown for radiation detection,” said Howard Milchberg, a professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering at UMD and senior author of the research paper. “The laser’s infrared wavelength is important, because it can easily and specifically detach electrons from oxygen ions,” added Milchberg, who also has an appointment at UMD’s Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics (IREAP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the air in the laser’s path begins to ionize, it has a measurable effect on the infrared light reflected, or backscattered, toward a detector. By tracking these changes, Schwartz, Milchberg and their colleagues were able to determine when the air began to ionize and how long it took to reach full ionization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The timing of the ionization process, or the electron avalanche breakdown, gives the researchers an indication of how many seed electrons were available to begin the avalanche. This estimate, in turn, can indicate how much radioactive material is present in the target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Timing of ionization is one of the most sensitive ways to detect initial electron density,” said Daniel Woodbury, a physics doctoral student at UMD and a co-author of the research paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers say that their method is highly specific and sensitive to the detection of radioactive material. Without a laser pulse, radioactive material alone will not induce an electron avalanche. Similarly, a laser pulse alone will not induce an avalanche, without the seed electrons created by the radioactive material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the method remains a proof-of-concept exercise for now, the researchers envision further engineering developments that they hope will enable practical applications to enhance security at ports of entry across the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Right now we’re working with a lab-sized laser, but in 10 years or so, engineers may be able to fit a system like this inside a van,” Schwartz said. “Anywhere you can park a truck, you can deploy such a system. This would provide a very powerful tool to monitor activity at ports.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to Milchberg, Schwartz and Woodbury, UMD-affiliated co-authors of the research paper include Phillip Sprangle, professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering with an appointment at IREAP, and Joshua Isaacs, a physics doctoral student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>UMD’s Thriving Workplace Initiative is making the University of Maryland a great place to work by providing tools and support to foster engaged, inclusive and empowered faculty and staff across campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Monday, its Five to Thrive list offers five strategies crowdsourced from research, experts and our own UMD community to help your workplace thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to build a Thriving Workplace? Here are this week’s tips:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Check your attitude. What you say is only part of an interaction; <em>how</em> you say it is just as important. For best results, look people in the eye, put down your phone and avoid crossing your arms.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don’t curb your enthusiasm. Last month, <a href=\"https://today.umd.edu/articles/five-thrive-15-fc67e90e-6dc5-4592-987d-0c4228308b5e\">we discussed how to limit the exclamation point</a>, but that doesn’t mean enthusiasm in the office is unwelcome. Energy—whether it’s a wide smile, relish to tackle a project or a well-placed fist bump—is uplifting, contagious and motivational.</li>\r\n\t<li>Practice self-care. Know when it’s time to take a break, go home or cash in vacation days. Taking care of your health and personal relationships resets your body and brain and translates to improved productivity.</li>\r\n\t<li>Build a better mousetrap. One benefit of a large university is virtually unlimited skillsets, so ask for input on new ways of doing things. Listen intently and work to implement one new idea from your colleagues each semester.</li>\r\n\t<li>Put your to-do list on a diet. On your daily to-do list, select one or two things that must get done; it creates a focus and priority for your day and a sense of accomplishment when it’s done.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Participate in the Thriving Workplace Survey, April 1–12. Take five to 10 minutes to reflect on life at work and help the university create more engaged, inclusive workplaces.

Maryland limited the Highlanders to 29.7 percent shooting, forced 17 turnovers and notched 11 steals. Standing tall in the middle of the zone was 6-foot-5 Austin, who proved to be a formidable obstacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I thought we were ready to go from the tip, especially on the defensive end,\" Frese said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressing on defense from the outset on both ends of court, Maryland forced four turnovers and held Radford (26–7) without a field goal until forward Destinee Walker popped a three-pointer with five and a half minutes gone to make it 16–5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Our start set the tone for the game, and it was something we couldn't recover from,\" Radford coach Mike McGuire said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the offensive end for Maryland, Mikesell, a freshman guard, made four three-pointers to set the school single-season record of 94. Jones made all six of her shots in the first half, and Charles helped UMD finish with a 46–40 rebounding advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is UMD’s 27th appearance in the NCAA Tournament, its ninth straight and 15th overall bid in Frese’s 17 years at Maryland. The Terps are 46–25 (.648) all-time in the tourney and 34–13 (.723) under Frese. She's led the Terps to eight Sweet Sixteens, six Elite Eights, three Final Fours and the 2006 NCAA title.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMaryland will take on No. 6-seeded UCLA (21–12) in the second round at 7&nbsp;tonight at Xfinity Center.

In the game’s final minute, Tigers guard Skylar Mays hit a huge three-pointer with 40 seconds remaining that put LSU (28-6) up, 67¬–64. Maryland’s Jalen Smith answered on the other end to tie it back up, but LSU’s Tremont Waters drove by three defenders and scooped in a banking layup with 1.6 seconds remaining to give the third-seeded Tigers the victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith led Maryland with 15 points, and sophomore forward Bruno Fernando added 10 points and 15 rebounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I love coaching them. They made coaching fun again,” Head Coach Mark Turgeon said. “I was proud of them, and they represented our school all year in the right way. They're great kids, and I don't know why it didn't go our way today.

    "body": "<p>Two fatal crashes involving Boeing 737 Max 8 planes have undermined confidence in the popular aircraft line, with countries around the world grounding the planes and airlines scrambling to refund or rebook thousands of customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deaths of 157 people on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, following the Lion Air Flight 610 crash in October that killed 189 off the coast of Indonesia, also have sparked heavy scrutiny of Boeing’s business practices as well as the oversight role of the Federal Aviation Administration, which waited days longer than many other nations to ground the planes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Ball, senior associate dean and Dean’s Chair in Management Science in the Robert H. Smith School of Business with a joint appointment in the Institute for Systems Research in the A. James Clark School of Engineering, said much of that scrutiny will focus on pilots’ training on the new Max 8 model.<img alt=\"Michael Ball\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"38a69477-a516-4572-b001-977555d9e4b8\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/320x381_Mike%20Ball.jpg\" width=\"30%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boeing wanted to produce the Max 8, its fastest-selling aircraft, without requiring pilots to spend time training extensively, as is standard with a new model, rather than an update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That retraining costs the airlines a lot of money,” Ball said. “Aircraft manufacturers must make such tradeoffs all the time, and as the systems become more complex the tradeoffs become more difficult to make.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, the most common impetus for changes in aviation policy has been aviation disasters, he said. “While I don't think the investigation into the relationship between Boeing and the FAA will lead to a smoking gun indicating major malfeasance, it is likely that quite significant changes will be made in the safety oversight process.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ball, the co-director and principal investigator of NEXTOR-II, an eight-university consortium funded by the FAA to carry out aviation operations research, outlined other challenges Boeing faces in the wake of the two crashes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fixing the Max 8</strong><br />\r\nThe aircraft’s problems, Ball says, appear rooted in software. “Not to minimize the issue, but software can be fixed. It’s not a fundamental issue with the aircraft. There is also the possibility of sensor malfunction, which would represent a more significant problem.” A software fix, he says, likely will take months to complete and thoroughly test. The FAA, meanwhile, has said it has grounded the aircraft until at least May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Restoring its Reputation </strong><br />\r\nAfter the second Max 8 crash, news emerged that several pilots had expressed concerns to Boeing about insufficient training on new Max 8 control features. “At Boeing, there should be and will be some soul-searching about this process,” Ball said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reputational damage for Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace manufacturer, may linger. Days after the Max 8 grounding, flight-booking website Kayak launched a search feature that allows users to exclude specific plane models from search results. “But over time, that reputational damage will go away,” Ball said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stemming the Financial Damage</strong><br />\r\nGlobally, about 370 of Max 8s were in operation and nearly 5,000 more were on order when the second plane crashed. “That’s a huge backlog of orders, and that’s not just going to go away,” said Ball. When airlines order aircraft, they put down a big deposit—generally 20 percent on an order priced in millions. Most airlines can’t afford to walk away from that kind of money, nor lose their place in line. Indonesia’s national airline, though, has told Boeing it wants to cancel its order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s also been talk of airlines suing Boeing for time lost on their grounded planes and other expenses related to the Max 8 issues. “That’s a legitimate thing they can sue for,” Ball said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Safety picture</strong><br />\r\nThe Max 8 crashes, the first in Indonesia and the second in Ethiopia, left 346 people dead. Nonetheless, he says, today’s aviation industry is safer than it’s ever been. Go back 30 years, and there were multiple commercial aircraft crashes every year in the United States alone. Today, that’s not the case. The most recent fatal crash in the U.S. was a decade ago. “A lot of that is because of the technology,” Ball said. “Even though planes are getting more complex, and there is this debate about how much control pilots should have versus the technology, the fact is the technology has substantially improved the safety of the systems in the past 30 years. The improvements are dramatic and measurable.”</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>Break out the brackets and dive into the office pool: March Madness is back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while workplaces nationwide will famously see buzzer beaters and “boss buttons” take priority over meetings and deadlines when the first round kicks off next Thursday, it’s also an annual opportunity for some good-natured competition. Does your number-crunching colleague promise to predict the winner based on stats? Does your superfan friend flame out with too much faith in their home team? Does someone hit on the next Cinderella by choosing winners based on the most adorable mascots?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sean Barnes Ph.D. ’12, an assistant professor of operations management in the Robert H. Smith School of Business, has suggestions for everyone looking to become the new master of March and take home an office pool victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Take note of the size of your pool.&nbsp;</strong>Is it small, containing only a few participants, or large? The larger the pool, the more you may need to differentiate your bracket by making some potentially unique selections. This differentiation could be achieved by picking some upsets early on, or by choosing a dark horse to take down a higher ranked team later in the tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do your homework.&nbsp;</strong>Do at least a little bit of research, whether reading a prediction article from a source such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-march-madness-predictions-work/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, or watching some games in the conference tournaments. This minimal effort may be enough to differentiate your preparation beyond what most of your competitors are willing to do. You’d be surprised how much of a better bracket you can build if you have a few good tips on teams expected to go deep in the tournament or pull off an early upset, or if you’ve actually seen the teams play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consider the stats.&nbsp;</strong>It’s worth digging into the historical data to gain an understanding of how to build your bracket. Read <a href=\"https://www.betfirm.com/seeds-national-championship-odds/\">articles</a>&nbsp;that contain statistics about the proportion of games in which each seed (1–16) advanced past each respective round in the tournament. These summaries provide a good frame of reference for how you should structure your bracket. For example, until last year, when the University of Maryland, Baltimore County defeated the University of Virginia, No. 1 seeds were undefeated against No. 16 seeds in the first round, so it’s a good move to pick the No. 1 seeds to advance to the second round. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 seeds are also highly likely to advance past the first round (at least 80% chance or higher), so it’s also not your best bet to go beyond one well-researched upset of a No. 3 or No. 4 seed (if at all). On the contrary, No. 10, No. 11 and No. 12 seeds have won 35–40 percent of their first-round games, which are prime candidates for an upset selection. During the tail end of the tournament, stick with the higher seeds. The top four seeds all have at least double-digit Final Four appearances, and the top three have participated in at least 10 championship games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find your Cinderella story.&nbsp;</strong>Consider the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/2019-03-06/march-madness-three-traits-cinderella-must-have\">characteristics</a>&nbsp;of a Cinderella team when choosing those lower-seed teams to advance. Choose a team in the top 50 in point scoring, ideally one with one or more top offensive players and consistently good three-point shooters. Look for a team with a positive turnover advantage, meaning it often gains more possessions per game than its opponents. And look for teams with consistent tournament appearances in recent years, because the players who have been to the Big Dance before are less likely to make mistakes in key moments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hedge your risky picks.&nbsp;</strong>For example, if you take a chance on an early-round upset, try not to push that team too deep in the tournament. That way, if you make the wrong pick, that mistake won’t propagate for several rounds. Set up those Cinderella teams to lose to a top seed (1–4) at some point down the road. If you get it right, you’ll cash in on the benefits regardless of whether you picked exactly how long that team would last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watch the games!&nbsp;</strong>Whether or not you’ve wagered money on your pool, having something at stake makes the games more exciting to watch because you have a preferred outcome for many of the games (until your picks get eliminated). The best part about the NCAA tournament is the variability in the outcomes due to the single-game elimination format, which is also why Warren Buffett has been willing to bet&nbsp;<a href=\"https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/13/593067641/does-your-office-ncaa-tournament-pool-offer-1-million-for-life\">$1M a year for life</a>&nbsp;that you won’t get it right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barnes usually fills out a bracket himself, but says he doesn’t always have time to do the research it takes to win. If you can’t invest the time for research, he says, watching the teams play leading up to the NCAA tournament offers some of the most valuable information. “When you can see teams in action, you get a better sense of where their strengths are and who might be underrated,” he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you opt in to your office pool, any effort you make to research your picks is better than nothing. “If you’re just blindly picking, you don’t have a much of a chance,” he says.</p>\r\n",

In fact, Fido is ahead of the curve compared to any babies you may have talked to recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-019-01255-4\">paper</a> published last week in <em>Animal Cognition</em>, Rochelle Newman, professor and chair of the UMD Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences, put four-legged friends to the “cocktail party” test to see how well they respond to their name amidst a babbling background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experiment was a new way to explore why infants struggle to pick their name out when background noise matches or exceeds the call for their attention, since pets, and especially service animals, are often expected to respond in noisy stores, airports and restaurants.<img alt=\"Dog\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"15828519-548c-4520-94e5-5932ccc88b77\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/dogstudy_1080.jpg\" width=\"40%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Dogs are social creatures who pay attention to the adults around them and have evolved to do so,” said Newman, whose co-authors were doctoral student Amritha Mallikarjun and lab manager Emily Shroads. “In some sense, they are a really good comparison to infants.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study found that the dogs (kept comfortable with their owners during the experiment and never exposed to harmful noise levels) responded to their own names when repeated along with a “foil” with the same syllable and stress pattern (i.e., “Henry” and “Sasha”), and a mashed-up recording of women reading book passages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was only when the background noise became louder than the name call that the dogs failed to respond; by contrast, infants generally don’t respond when the stimuli are at equal volumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We were kind of surprised dogs could do so at all,” Newman said. “Outperforming infants was only more surprising.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first takeaway from the study, she said, is that infants likely struggle in such environments due to their stage of development rather than a lack of language skills, seeing as “dogs don’t have language either and are doing better.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The takeaway for people working with furrier companions, Newman said, is that you probably have to raise your voice or move closer when surrounding noise can drown you out—particularly important if the dog in question is a service or K-9 animal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Recognizing that dogs may have trouble in those settings is worth knowing,” she said.</p>\r\n",

    "summary": "A new UMD-led study shows how academic departments at universities nationwide can take action to lessen workload inequities that often saddle women and underrepresented minority faculty with extra mentoring, advising and campus service work.",
    "body": "<p>A new <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207316\">UMD-led study</a> shows how academic departments at universities nationwide can take action to lessen workload inequities that often saddle women and underrepresented minority faculty with extra mentoring, advising and campus service work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While those are vital functions, such responsibilities leave less time for research. This proves especially problematic in STEM fields, where research products are highly valued and can affect career advancement, including tenure and promotion rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue of how departmental workloads are divided up have received far less attention than hiring. As a result, men are doing more research while women do more undergraduate teaching, according to the study published in <em>PLOS One.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"For decades, national surveys, interviews and focus groups have shown that faculty are dissatisfied with workload—some even leave institutions because of it,” says study coauthor KerryAnn O’Meara, associate dean in UMD’s College of Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O’Meara and colleagues from UMD, North Carolina State University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst designed an experiment featuring four interventions designed to balance faculty workload, implementing it over 18 months in 17 STEM departments (including the sciences, social sciences, mathematics and engineering) at a variety of institutions in Maryland, North Carolina and Massachusetts. They also monitored, but did not intervene, in 13 control departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four-step process involves:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Conducting a workshop using existing research to help department members recognize the role of unconscious bias in work disparities, says Courtney Lennartz, study coauthor and doctoral student in UMD’s Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology. “What the research has shown is that implicit bias is a factor in how work is distributed,” she says. “So, people may not be aware that they are asking women or minorities to serve more often in these positions.”</li>\r\n\t<li>Creating “dashboards” to transparently display workload activity by department members, allowing everyone to see balances of teaching, advising, service and research.</li>\r\n\t<li>Using the data from the dashboards to identify existing equity issues, along with sharing evidence-based workplace practices to “mitigate bias and proactively design for equity,” according to the study.</li>\r\n\t<li>Offering an optional professional development webinar series in which the departments discussed the action plans they’d developed to tackle the problem.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The results indicate that the intervention workshops made a difference. Compared with the control departments, faculty in participating departments were more likely to report equitable work practices and conditions, and willingness to tackle workload inequities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We found that these participating departments had better conditions for work practices in place that would help support equity across workloads and that their departments were more ready to institute change,” Lennartz says. “They felt that teaching and service work was more fair across the department in terms of gender, rank and ethnicity. We’re hopeful that as departments look at their distribution of workloads that that can help them institute change for women and underrepresented minority faculty.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study is ongoing. Currently, the intervention program is being tested in an additional group of departments, this time under a condensed timeline of less than a year. Eventually, the goal is to offer a set of resources that academic departments can use to nurture fairness and faculty satisfaction in their working environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are in the second phase of the project now, and beginning to disseminate some of our findings,” O’Meara says. “In the fifth and final year of the project we hope to share resources and materials created so more departments can enact these practices and improve workload equity—in perception and reality.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional information can be found at the <a href=\"https://facultyworkloadandrewardsproject.umd.edu/project%20leadership.html\">Faculty Workload and Rewards Project</a>, or in a project overview video, below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbRxrVA8C_4\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>A new microscopy technique developed by University of Maryland researchers could make the popular LASIK vision-correction surgery more accurate—and even nearly eliminate the need for any cutting of the eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The findings by<strong> </strong>Giuliano Scarcelli<strong>, </strong>an assistant professor in the Fischell Department of Bioengineering, and members of his <a href=\"http://www.onlylightcandothat.org/\">Optics Biotech Laboratory</a>, were published this week in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.103901\"><em>Physical Review Letters</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 20 years since the Food and Drug Administration first approved LASIK surgery, more than 10 million Americans have had the procedure, which can free patients from wearing glasses or contact lenses—if it works as planned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While LASIK has a very high success rate, virtually every procedure involves an element of guesswork, because doctors have no way to precisely measure the refractive properties of the eye. Instead, they rely heavily on approximations that correlate with the patient’s vision acuity—how close to 20/20 he or she can see without corrective lenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scarcelli’s new microscopy technique could allow doctors to perform LASIK using precise measurements of how the eye focuses light.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This could represent a tremendous first for LASIK and other refractive procedures,” Scarcelli said. “Light is focused by the eye’s cornea because of its shape and what is known as its refractive index. But until now, we could only measure its shape. Thus, today’s refractive procedures rely solely on observed changes to the cornea, and they are not always accurate.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cornea—the outermost layer of the eye—functions like a window that controls and focuses light that enters the eye. When light strikes the cornea, it is bent—or refracted. The lens then fine-tunes the light’s path to produce a sharp image on the retina, which converts the light into electrical impulses that are interpreted by the brain as images. Common vision problems, such as nearsightedness or farsightedness, are caused by the eye’s inability to bring an image into sharp focus on the retina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To fix this, LASIK surgeons use lasers to alter the shape of the cornea and change its focal point. But, they do this without any ability to precisely measure how much the path of light is bent when it enters the cornea.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To measure the path light takes, one needs to measure a quantity known as the refractive index; it represents the ratio of the velocity of light in a vacuum to its velocity in a particular material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By mapping the distribution and variations of the local refractive index within the eye, doctors would know the precise degree of corneal refraction. Equipped with this information, they could better tailor the LASIK procedure so that instead of simply having better vision, patients could expect to walk away with perfect vision—or vision that tops 20/20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even more, doctors might no longer need to cut into the cornea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Non-ablative technologies are already being developed to change the refractive index of the cornea, locally, using a laser,” Scarcelli said. “Providing local refractive index measurements will be critical for their success.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to Scarcelli, bioengineering Ph.D. student Antonio Fiore, the paper’s first author, and Carlo Bevilacqua, a visiting student from<strong> </strong>the University of Bari Aldo Moro in Italy, contributed to the paper.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>The original story played out like an urban nightmare: A woman rolls down her window to help a Baltimore panhandler who appears to be holding a baby, when a man tries to steal her purse and stabs her to death in the ensuing struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The news rocketed around the Internet, with Baltimore’s homeless describing a steep decline in generosity and Oprah Winfrey tweeting that she would think twice before giving money to panhandlers again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the story of that December night fell apart earlier this week when <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-jacquelyn-smith-update-20190303-story.html\">police said the panhandler tale was a ruse</a> concocted by Jacquelyn Smith’s husband and stepdaughter, now charged with her murder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oftentimes, we have these negative depictions of our city,” Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said at a news conference, “and it’s rather unfortunate when people take advantage of these negative perceptions.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against that background, Reeve Vanneman, a UMD sociology professor who teaches a course on homelessness, recently shared some perspective about homeless people and panhandlers with <em>Maryland Today</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Most homeless people don’t panhandle</strong>: With everything from bad weather and verbal abuse to the psychic toll of being constantly ignored, panhandling is difficult work, Vanneman said. “Homeless people are having a hard enough time as it is,” he said. “The additional burden of having to panhandle could make life unbearable.”</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Housing prices are to blame</strong>: While homelessness is attributed to everything from drug use to a shortage of mental health facilities, Vanneman said rising housing costs are the biggest factor. The combination of increasing poverty with urban renewal projects tearing down low-income homes caused a crisis in the 1980s. “All the places that poor people used to live were gone,” he said.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>The situation has gotten better</strong>: Between 2007 and 2017, homelessness declined by 14 percent nationally and, after a spike during the recession, by nearly 25 percent in Maryland, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Vanneman attributed it to a “revolution” in treatment: Instead of trying to fix an underlying problem like addiction before putting a person in a permanent home, government and nonprofit groups have switched to a “housing first” approach in the last decade, he said. “It’s been much more successful.”</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>But improvement isn’t across the board</strong>: Overheated real estate markets, like Seattle (which saw homelessness rise <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/homeless/seattles-homeless-population-grows-more-than-40-percent-in-two-years/281-497511264\">more than 40 percent in just two years</a>), will continue to have problems, Vanneman said. “If middle-income people are having a problem finding a place, then many lower-income people just won’t find a place,” he said. “Rising prices and stagnant wages aren’t easy problems to solve. If we had an answer to that, we’d all be a lot better.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The garden features massive, standing aluminum cylinders that physics Professor Joseph Weber designed to detect gravitational waves. These are ripples in space-time predicted by physicist Albert Einstein’s theory of gravitation, but which even he didn’t believe were measurable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, Einstein was wrong, and in 2017, the principal scientists of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) won the&nbsp; Nobel Prize in physics for detecting gravitational waves resulting from the collision of two black holes. (One of those three Nobel laureates, Rainer Weiss, will be attending today’s ceremony and speaking on campus at 4 p.m.)<img alt=\"Weber bars\" data-align=\"left\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"75c0f810-18d6-4dc8-8037-dec62098cf1d\" src=\"https://hub.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/WeberMemorialGarden_03112019_1672_1920x1080.jpg\" width=\"60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The discovery opens up a new field of astronomy that doesn’t rely on electromagnetic waves such as visible light or radio waves. It has already resulted in some surprising discoveries deep in space, including how neutron star collisions are responsible for gold and other heavy elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Weber himself announced he had found gravitational waves in 1969, to great fanfare in the world of science, few if any today believe he was correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He fought vociferously through the 1970s and 1980s against a growing consensus of physicists that his method had failed. But none dispute that he created the field out of nothing, and deserves some of the credit for its eventual success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Before Weber, I don’t think anyone had ever spent more than 10 minutes trying to understand how to detect gravitational waves in the lab,” said physics Professor Emeritus Charles Misner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The “Weber bars” designed to detect the subtle gravitational waves weren’t capable of such a feat, but scientists attracted to the field by Weber’s 1969 announcement were as determined as he was, Misner said. “They tried, and they kept trying, and eventually, after 50 years and a billion dollars, they discovered gravitational waves.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had Weber never made his incorrect claim, it may well have doomed the search for gravitational waves, Misner said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“(LIGO) was such a difficult thing to get built, that if it had started 10 years later, it would have hit a political wall,” he said. “It might have been another century before anyone discovered gravitational waves.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The center also engages in research and advocacy to help prevent trafficking and improve survivor services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Human trafficking is a public health issue,” said School of Public Health Dean Boris Lushniak. “To tackle it we must complement the criminal justice and social service response with prevention strategies targeted to specific populations. Our School of Public Health is uniquely positioned to partner with the SAFE Center on efforts to prevent trafficking, identify victims and provide evidence-based treatment and support for survivors.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery in which force, fraud or coercion is used to compel women, children and men into commercial sex, forced labor and domestic servitude. The crime occurs throughout the United States, and Baltimore and the District of Columbia rank among the cities with the highest number of victims per capita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are excited to establish a new home at the School of Public Health,” said SAFE Center founder and Director Ambassador Susan Esserman. “The school’s emphasis on prevention, health and wellness, and quality of life closely aligns with our mission of helping human trafficking survivors overcome the trauma of their trafficking and rebuild their lives.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SAFE Center’s newly established position within the School of Public Health recognizes the interconnected nature of human trafficking to other forms of violence and systemic inequities. The center’s efforts to fight human trafficking will benefit from the multifaceted, holistic approach that is central to public health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>School of Public Health faculty and students could be engaged to assess what health care providers across Maryland know about human trafficking and to train them to better identify and refer trafficking survivors for needed services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We want to engage the medical and health care communities in a systemic way because they are part of the front line in identifying human trafficking survivors,” Esserman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its founding in 2016, the SAFE Center has:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>provided services to more than 100 survivors of sex and labor trafficking;</li>\r\n\t<li>launched a 24/7 human trafficking crisis intervention program in Prince George’s County;</li>\r\n\t<li>held leadership roles on the human trafficking task forces of Prince George’s and Montgomery counties, as well as on Maryland’s state human trafficking task force; and</li>\r\n\t<li>expanded onsite provision of bilingual immigration and crime victims’ rights legal services, as well as bilingual mental health services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The SAFE Center also just launched a pilot research project to determine the nature and prevalence of human trafficking in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties, and has taken a leadership role in advocating for the passage of several trafficking-related bills in the Maryland legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to its home base with the School of Public Health, the SAFE Center will continue its collaborative work with the Schools of Social Work, Law, Dentistry and Nursing in Baltimore; and the Schools of Public Policy and Business; and Colleges of Education; Arts and Humanities; and Behavioral and Social Sciences in College Park.</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p>UMD’s Thriving Workplace Initiative is making the University of Maryland a great place to work by providing tools and support to foster engaged, inclusive and empowered faculty and staff across campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Monday, its Five to Thrive list offers five strategies crowdsourced from research, experts and our own UMD community to help your workplace thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week’s tips come directly from a few of the latest campus “Thrivers”: Jeff Russo, Manager of UMD’s Bakery; Sean Wynn; Manager of Campus Mail Services; Department of Entomology Chair Leslie Pick; Vice President of Student Affairs Linda Clement; and Marty Wollesen, executive director of The Clarice. Here’s how they make their workplace thrive:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Identify the need and match it with the skill. Redefining the roles of staff can help your department improve. Be sure to provide the members with the flexibility to train for new responsibilities and roles.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have a “smart heart.” As a manager, practice critical traits like enthusiasm, agreeableness, positivity and self-regulation. Without them, the smart things you say won’t translate.</li>\r\n\t<li>Be specific in your praise. Instead of “great job,” go deeper. Explain why the work was great or compare the job to another project done previously to illustrate their progress and growth.</li>\r\n\t<li>In the face of great change or challenge, practice team care. This may require more frequent check-ins or altering your job description to lighten the load. Be sure to set the tone: Remind early and often that uncertainty happens but is not forever.</li>\r\n\t<li>Start PRD goals with the employee. Let employees draft their individual goals, then collaborate to fine-tune them. Goals can include outside projects, discovery, specific areas of concentration or professional development. They should not include what is already in the job description. One important rule: Goals can engage other people but cannot rely on them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out more tips from our campus Thrivers on the <a href=\"https://uofmd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=ed02924fdc59416f84ecd0987bb5ba55\">UMD Thriver Map</a>, which profiles success stories right here at UMD and offers ideas you can apply today.</p>\r\n",
